This is a complete example of a generated Agent Team Prompt. Claude uses this to calibrate the quality, specificity, and format of generated output.

**Inputs used:**
- Project Name: TaskFlow
- Primary Goal: Build a REST API for task management with user authentication and team collaboration
- Tech Stack: Node 20, TypeScript, Express, PostgreSQL, Prisma
- Source of Truth: `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`
- Security Invariants: JWT auth required on all endpoints, no secrets in code, rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Project Type: api-service

# TaskFlow — Agent Team Prompt

## 1. Project Context

- **Project:** TaskFlow
- **Goal:** Build a REST API for task management with user authentication and team collaboration
- **Tech Stack:** Node 20, TypeScript 5.x, Express 4.x, PostgreSQL 16, Prisma ORM
- **Source of Truth:** `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`

All architecture, features, and implementation decisions must comply with `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`.

---

## 2. Source of Truth Rule

`PROJECT_BRIEF.md` is the single source of truth for this project. It overrides all assumptions, prior knowledge, and agent opinions.

**Authority hierarchy:**
1. `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` (highest authority)
2. Approved plans (approved by Critic)
3. Team Charter (this document)
4. Agent judgment (lowest — must defer to above)

**Conflict resolution:** If `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` is silent or ambiguous on a requirement, **STOP and ask for clarification** — do not infer, assume, or invent.

---

## 3. Team Roster

Create an Agent Team with the following teammates:

### Architect
**Purpose:** Define data models, API surface, system boundaries, and technology decisions for TaskFlow.

**Responsibilities:**
- Design Prisma schemas for users, tasks, teams, and permissions
- Define REST endpoint structure and response formats
- Establish authentication flow (JWT issuance, refresh, revocation)
- Review all plans for architectural consistency

**Boundaries (Must NOT):**
- Must NOT write implementation code (routes, middleware, business logic)
- Must NOT approve plans without verifying security invariants are preserved

### Implementer
**Purpose:** Write production code for API routes, middleware, business logic, and database operations.

**Responsibilities:**
- Implement Express routes per approved plan
- Write Prisma queries and business logic
- Implement JWT authentication middleware
- Write unit and integration tests

**Boundaries (Must NOT):**
- Must NOT change Prisma schema without Architect approval
- Must NOT add npm dependencies without RFC
- Must NOT bypass authentication middleware for convenience

### API Designer
**Purpose:** Define endpoint specifications, request/response schemas, error formats, and API documentation.

**Responsibilities:**
- Write OpenAPI spec for all endpoints
- Define request validation schemas (Zod)
- Standardize error response format
- Define pagination, filtering, and sorting contracts

**Boundaries (Must NOT):**
- Must NOT implement route handlers

**Purpose:** Review plans for completeness, security compliance, testability, and edge case coverage.

**Responsibilities:**
- Review every implementation plan before coding starts
- Verify plans preserve all security invariants
- Check test strategies cover happy path + edge cases
- Validate interface contracts between agents

**Boundaries (Must NOT):**
- Must NOT write implementation code
- Must NOT approve plans that skip test strategy
- Must NOT rubber-stamp — every approval must reference specific checklist items

### DevOps
**Purpose:** CI/CD pipeline, Docker configuration, environment setup, and deployment.

**Responsibilities:**
- Create Dockerfile and docker-compose for local development
- Set up GitHub Actions CI pipeline (lint, test, build)
- Configure environment variable management
- Document deployment and rollback procedures

**Boundaries (Must NOT):**
- Must NOT modify application business logic
- Must NOT store secrets in Docker images or CI config
- Must NOT change database schemas

---

## 4. Agent Responsibility Blocks

### Architect

**Scope:** `prisma/schema.prisma`, `src/types/`, `docs/architecture/`

**Deliverables:**
- Prisma schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
- TypeScript type definitions (`src/types/user.ts`, `src/types/task.ts`, `src/types/team.ts`)
- Authentication flow diagram (`docs/architecture/auth-flow.md`)
- Interface contracts document (`docs/architecture/contracts.md`)

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Prisma schema includes all entities with relationships and constraints
- [ ] TypeScript types generated from Prisma and match API response shapes
- [ ] Auth flow covers: register, login, refresh, revoke, password reset
- [ ] Interface contracts defined between all agent pairs
- [ ] Architectural decisions logged in CLAUDE.md

**Stop Conditions — HALT and escalate if:**
- `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` is ambiguous on a data model or relationship
- A proposed feature requires a third-party auth provider not in the spec
- Any schema change would affect more than 3 existing endpoints

**Test Requirements:**
- Unit tests for: schema validation helpers, type guard functions
- Integration tests for: Prisma migration runs cleanly, seed data loads

---

### Implementer

**Scope:** `src/routes/`, `src/middleware/`, `src/services/`, `src/utils/`

**Deliverables:**
- Auth routes (`src/routes/auth.ts`) — register, login, refresh, logout
- Task CRUD routes (`src/routes/tasks.ts`)
- Team routes (`src/routes/teams.ts`)
- Auth middleware (`src/middleware/auth.ts`)
- Service layer (`src/services/task.service.ts`, `src/services/user.service.ts`, `src/services/team.service.ts`)

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] All routes match the OpenAPI spec from API Designer
- [ ] Auth middleware validates JWT and attaches user to request
- [ ] All database queries use Prisma (no raw SQL without approval)
- [ ] Unit tests written for all service functions
- [ ] Integration tests for auth flow (register -> login -> access protected route)
- [ ] Error responses match the standardized error format
- [ ] No TODO comments without linked issues

**Stop Conditions — HALT and escalate if:**
- `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` is ambiguous on a feature requirement
- An endpoint needs to bypass authentication
- A new npm package is needed (file RFC)
- Prisma schema needs modification (request Architect approval)

**Test Requirements:**
- Unit tests for: service layer functions (mock Prisma client)
- Integration tests for: full auth flow, task CRUD operations, team membership

---

### API Designer

**Scope:** `docs/api/`, `src/schemas/`

**Deliverables:**
- OpenAPI spec (`docs/api/openapi.yaml`)
- Zod validation schemas (`src/schemas/auth.schema.ts`, `src/schemas/task.schema.ts`, `src/schemas/team.schema.ts`)
- Error format spec (`docs/api/errors.md`)
- Pagination spec (`docs/api/pagination.md`)

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Every endpoint documented with request/response examples
- [ ] Zod schemas match OpenAPI definitions exactly
- [ ] Error codes standardized (4xx for client, 5xx for server)
- [ ] Pagination format defined (cursor-based or offset)
- [ ] API versioning strategy documented

**Stop Conditions — HALT and escalate if:**
- `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` doesn't specify an endpoint's behavior
- A breaking change to an existing endpoint is needed
- Rate limiting requirements are unclear

**Test Requirements:**
- Unit tests for: Zod schema validation (valid + invalid inputs)
- Integration tests for: OpenAPI spec validates against implemented routes

---

### Critic

**Scope:** Plan review, approval decisions, quality gates

**Deliverables:**
- Plan review checklists (per plan submitted)
- Security review notes
- Test strategy validation reports
- Drift check reports (after every 2-3 completed tasks)

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Every plan reviewed with explicit pass/fail per section
- [ ] Security invariants checked against every plan
- [ ] Test strategy validated for coverage of edge cases
- [ ] Rejection feedback is specific and actionable (not "needs work")
- [ ] All reviews logged in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Drift check performed: current work aligns with `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`

**Stop Conditions — HALT and escalate if:**
- A plan violates a security invariant and the author pushes back
- Two agents have conflicting plans that both reference `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`
- A plan requires a feature not in `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`
- Drift check reveals work that cannot be traced back to `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`

---

### DevOps

**Scope:** `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.github/workflows/`, `scripts/`

**Deliverables:**
- Dockerfile (`Dockerfile`)
- Docker Compose for local dev (`docker-compose.yml`)
- CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- Environment template (`.env.example`)
- Deployment guide (`docs/deployment.md`)

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] `docker compose up` starts the full stack (API + PostgreSQL)
- [ ] CI pipeline runs: lint, type-check, unit tests, integration tests, build
- [ ] `.env.example` documents all required environment variables
- [ ] No secrets in any committed file
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented

**Stop Conditions — HALT and escalate if:**
- CI needs access to external services not in the spec
- A new infrastructure dependency is needed (e.g., Redis, message queue)
- Deployment target is not specified in `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`

**Test Requirements:**
- Integration tests for: Docker build succeeds, CI pipeline passes on clean checkout

---

## 5. Interface Contracts

### Architect -> Implementer
- **Input:** Prisma schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`) + TypeScript types (`src/types/*.ts`)
- **Output:** Implementation follows schema exactly; any needed changes go through RFC
- **Example:**
```typescript
// src/types/task.ts
interface Task {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string | null;
  status: "todo" | "in_progress" | "done";
  assigneeId: string | null;
  teamId: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### API Designer -> Implementer
- **Input:** OpenAPI spec (`docs/api/openapi.yaml`) + Zod schemas (`src/schemas/*.ts`)
- **Output:** Routes implement exactly the specified endpoints with matching request/response shapes
- **Example:**
```yaml
# POST /api/tasks
requestBody:
  content:
    application/json:
      schema:
        type: object
        required: [title, teamId]
        properties:
          title: { type: string, maxLength: 255 }
          description: { type: string, nullable: true }
          assigneeId: { type: string, format: uuid, nullable: true }
          teamId: { type: string, format: uuid }
responses:
  201:
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/Task'
  400:
    $ref: '#/components/responses/ValidationError'
  401:
    $ref: '#/components/responses/Unauthorized'
```

### Implementer -> Critic
- **Input:** Plan document (markdown) with: steps, files, schemas, edge cases, test approach, rollback
- **Output:** Approval (pass/fail per section + specific feedback)
- **Example:**
```markdown
## Plan Review: Task CRUD Implementation
- Steps: PASS
- Files: PASS
- Data formats: PASS — Zod schemas match OpenAPI spec
- Edge cases: FAIL — Missing: what happens when assigneeId references a user not in the team?
- Test approach: PASS
- Rollback: PASS

**Verdict: REJECTED — fix edge case handling for cross-team assignment, then resubmit.**
```

### DevOps -> All Agents
- **Input:** Environment variable template (`.env.example`)
- **Output:** All agents use `process.env.VAR_NAME` — no hardcoded values
- **Example:**
```bash
# .env.example
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/taskflow
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-here
JWT_EXPIRY=15m
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY=7d
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

---

## 6. Approval Protocol

**No code may be written before plan approval.**

Before implementing any feature, the responsible agent must submit a plan containing:
1. **Steps** — Ordered sequence of what will be built
2. **Files touched/created** — Exact paths
3. **Data formats** — Schemas with concrete examples
4. **Edge cases** — What could go wrong + how it's handled
5. **Test approach** — What tests, what they cover, what they mock
6. **Rollback strategy** — How to undo if something breaks

**Approval flow:**
1. Implementer writes the plan
2. Critic reviews the plan for: completeness, architectural consistency, security compliance, testability, edge case coverage
3. Critic approves (pass) or rejects (fail + specific feedback)
4. If rejected: revise and resubmit
5. Only after approval: implementation begins

---

## 7. Stop Conditions (Global)

**ALL agents must STOP immediately if:**
- `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` is missing or ambiguous on a requirement
- A change touches security constraints (JWT auth, rate limiting, input validation)
- Any agent proposes a new npm dependency not in `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`
- A proposed change would break an existing interface contract
- The implementation would require modifying another agent's owned files

**Action when stopped:** Follow the Escalation Protocol below.

---

## 7.1. Escalation Protocol

When an agent halts (due to a stop condition or ambiguity), follow this process:

**Escalation format:**
```markdown
## Escalation: [Short title]
- **Decision needed:** [What must be decided]
- **Options:** [2-3 concrete options]
- **Recommendation:** [What this agent recommends and why]
- **Blocked work:** [What cannot proceed until this is resolved]
```

**Rules:**
1. **All escalations go to the user.** Format using the template above so the user can decide quickly.
2. **If the user is unavailable:** Log the escalation in `CLAUDE.md` as a "Pending Decision," mark status as `blocked` in `TEAM_AGENTS.json`, and stop work on the blocked task. Unrelated tasks may continue.
3. **Agent-to-agent disagreements:** Each agent writes their position as an RFC. The Critic arbitrates implementation disputes; the Architect arbitrates architecture disputes. If the arbiter cannot resolve or is party to the disagreement, escalate to the user.
4. **Boundary overrides are forbidden.** No agent may override another agent's "Must NOT" boundary. Boundary changes require explicit user approval.

---

## 8. Change Control (RFC Process)

Any feature, dependency, or architectural change NOT in `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` requires an RFC.

**RFC format:**
```markdown
## RFC: [Title]
- **Why needed:** [What problem this solves]
- **Impacted files/commands:** [What changes]
- **Risk/complexity:** [Low / Medium / High + explanation]
- **Approval required from:** [Critic / Architect]
```

---

## 9. Operational Constraints

- **Runtime:** Node 20 LTS
- **Language:** TypeScript 5.x (strict mode)
- **Module system:** ESM only (`"type": "module"` in package.json)
- **ORM:** Prisma (no raw SQL without RFC)
- **Validation:** Zod
- **Sandboxed write paths:** `src/`, `prisma/`, `docs/`, `tests/`
- **Dependency policy:** No new npm packages without RFC approval
- **Simplicity rule:** Prefer simplest implementation. No new frameworks.

---

## 10. Security Invariants (Unchangeable Rules)

These rules **must never be broken**:

- JWT authentication required on all endpoints except `POST /auth/register` and `POST /auth/login`
- No secrets (API keys, JWT secrets, database passwords) in source code or logs
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints (register, login, refresh) — max 10 requests/minute per IP
- All user input validated with Zod schemas at route handler entry
- Database queries use Prisma (parameterized by default) — no string concatenation in queries
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (minimum 12 rounds)
- CORS configured to allow only specified origins
- HTTP security headers set (Helmet.js)

---

## 11. Documentation Sync Rule

All agents must update `CLAUDE.md` when making decisions.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Decision: [Short title]
- **Context:** [Why this decision was needed]
- **Alternatives considered:** [What other options existed]
- **Chosen approach:** [What was selected and why]
- **Consequences:** [What this enables, what it constrains]
- **Owner:** [Agent role] | **Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
```

---

## 12. Budget and Simplicity Constraints

- Prefer the **simplest implementation** that meets requirements
- No new frameworks or libraries without RFC approval
- Reuse Express middleware patterns before building custom
- Phase 2/3 features (WebSocket, real-time, email notifications) must not block Phase 1 (REST API)
- No premature abstractions

---

## 13. Agent Persistence (Save & Reuse)

At the end of each work session, save the entire team to `TEAM_AGENTS.json`. This file captures every agent's identity, goals, and completed work so the team can be reloaded later.

**Save location:** `TEAM_AGENTS.json` (project root)

**At session end, the lead agent must update `TEAM_AGENTS.json`** with each agent's current status, completed work, files touched, and any blockers.

**At session start, if `TEAM_AGENTS.json` exists**, agents read it to understand their role, what was previously completed, and what's blocked.

**Reuse scenarios:**
- **Continue** — Same agents, same goals, pick up where they left off
- **Update** — Same agents, new goals, prior work preserved
- **New feature** — Same team composition, fresh goals, prior work archived

**Example `TEAM_AGENTS.json` after first session:**
```json

```

**Relationship to Section 11:**
- Section 11 (CLAUDE.md) captures *why* decisions were made (strategic, human-readable)
- Section 13 (TEAM_AGENTS.json) captures *who* did *what* and *who they are* (structural, machine-readable)
- Together they give a new session full context without reverse-engineering git history

---

## High-Leverage One-Liners

- Treat `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` as law; never invent requirements.
- If unclear, ask a question OR write an RFC — **do not guess**.
- Output schemas first, then logic.
- Prefer deterministic code; no AI/LLM calls in the API.
- Every change must preserve JWT auth + rate limiting + input validation.
- Test strategy is a deliverable, not an afterthought.
- Critic runs a drift check after every 2-3 completed tasks: re-read the spec, flag scope creep, gaps, and violations.

---
